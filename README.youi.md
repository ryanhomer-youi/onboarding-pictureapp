# You.i Engine One React Native

## Building for macOS

You first need to install the JS dependencies:

> yarn install

Now, run the following to build and run a YiRN application (in this case on OSX):

> yarn build-osx

At this point you can run the application from command line, or open the application in Xcode.

In a seperate window start the javascript bundler.

> yarn start

And then run the application.

> yarn run-app
